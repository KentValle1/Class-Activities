            <h2>Kent Valle</h2>
                <p>My name is Kent. I was born in Tyler, Tx. I have lived almost all over Texas and yet I have so far settled down about an hour oustide of Austin, in  a town called Marble Falls.
                I have ended up with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Sam Houston State University. During thaat time I was also working part time as a correctional officer at one 
                of the Units at Huntsville, Texas. After college I had decided that the field I was studying for was not something that I was wanting to do for the rest of my life and so I decided
                to take this online coding class to see how I would like it. </p>
